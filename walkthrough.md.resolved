# The Purple Pulse — Execution Walkthrough

The execution of the **Purple Pulse** implementation plan is fully complete and verified. The codebase is now a robust, production-ready monorepo ready for the Monad Blitz hackathon presentation.

## What Was Accomplished

- **Phase 0: Scaffolding** 
  - Monorepo initialized with `contracts/` (Hardhat) and `frontend/` (Next.js 14 App Router) directories. Required dependencies (Viem, Wagmi, Tone.js, Tailwind, RainbowKit) were successfully installed.
- **Phase 1: Smart Contract**
  - Implemented [PulseCore.sol](file:///c:/Users/DELL/OneDrive/Desktop/Monad%20Blitz%202026/contracts/contracts/PulseCore.sol) with parallel-friendly mapping structures to highlight Monad's Parallel EVM. 
  - Wrote a 9-part test suite validating toggle behavior, credit systems, parallel safety, and packed state compression.
  - Successfully resolved ESM vs CJS Hardhat conflicts to ensure `npx hardhat test` runs beautifully on modern module targets.
- **Phase 2-5: Frontend / Audio-Visual Engine**
  - Integrated the **Cyber-Purple** theme via custom globals.css for full glassmorphism and neon glows.
  - Set up `WagmiProvider` configured directly to the **Monad Testnet RPC**.
  - Built custom [useAudioEngine](file:///c:/Users/DELL/OneDrive/Desktop/Monad%20Blitz%202026/frontend/src/hooks/useAudioEngine.ts#7-68) and [useMonadSync](file:///c:/Users/DELL/OneDrive/Desktop/Monad%20Blitz%202026/frontend/src/hooks/useMonadSync.ts#15-88) hooks bridging real-time WebSocket events to Tone.js 16th-note quantizations.
  - Developed the UI: [SequencerGrid](file:///c:/Users/DELL/OneDrive/Desktop/Monad%20Blitz%202026/frontend/src/components/SequencerGrid.tsx#16-147), [TilePad](file:///c:/Users/DELL/OneDrive/Desktop/Monad%20Blitz%202026/frontend/src/components/TilePad.tsx#13-64) (with ripple effects/heatmapping), and the [Dashboard](file:///c:/Users/DELL/OneDrive/Desktop/Monad%20Blitz%202026/frontend/src/components/Dashboard.tsx#13-34) (TPS Meter, Finality Clock, Hype Meter).
- **Phase 6: PWA Support**
  - Added [manifest.json](file:///c:/Users/DELL/OneDrive/Desktop/Monad%20Blitz%202026/frontend/public/manifest.json) and theme meta tags to enable "Crowd Mode" responsive installation on mobile devices.

## Verification & Validation

1. **Smart Contract Tests**
   - Executed `npx hardhat test`.
   - **Result:** `<span style="color: #10B981">Passed 9/9 tests (1s)</span>`. Validated that the `getPackedGridState()` correctly masks binary states and that identical timestamps won't block parallel updates.
2. **Next.js Production Build**
   - Fixed a strict TypeScript typing error with `BigInt` literals and `WagmiProvider` config.
   - Bypassed Next.js aggressive SSG restrictions on Web3 context by enforcing `force-dynamic` rendering.
   - Executed `npm run build`.
   - **Result:** `<span style="color: #10B981">Compiled successfully (10.6s)</span>`. The Turbopack engine generated all chunks correctly with zero fatal ESLint/TS errors.

## Next Steps for the User

You are completely ready for development and the presentation stage! 

**To Start the Chain (Terminal 1):**
```bash
cd contracts
PRIVATE_KEY="YOUR_WALLET_KEY" npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network monadTestnet
```

**To Start the Frontend (Terminal 2):**
Copy the deployed address to [frontend/src/lib/contract.ts](file:///c:/Users/DELL/OneDrive/Desktop/Monad%20Blitz%202026/frontend/src/lib/contract.ts), then run:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Good luck at the Monad Blitz 2026 hackathon! Let the 10,000 TPS baseline carry the beat.
